I'm a developer with a passion for programming and building some projects. I like to work with different languages and at the same time also to check out how this stuff works. This blog is my space to share different things that I have found out whilst building something. 

Maybe you can also be interested in the stuff I am doing. Regardless of that: I hope this site is helpful in any part of your journey.
