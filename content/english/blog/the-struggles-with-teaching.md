Over the years I have had many experiences where I wasn't the person that received the information, but rather was the one that tried to educate others on that specific topic. Those ranged from things with the computer like programming and the usage of software to social sciences like history and politics as well as more creative stuff like art and writing. And to be honest: I don't think I was always a good teacher. 

Often I did things wrong or even conveyed **wrong** information. Sometimes I didn't listen to the problems the recipient had and sometimes I even refused to help people because I thought that this would be "better".

And all of that is stuff that I regret. And I believe that stuff like that will always happen in my life. In retroperspective it is obvious. So, with this blog article I want to write about different stuff I learned whilst teaching and how to maybe be a better teacher. And this does not only apply to people that actually have a job named "Teacher". This applies to everybody as everybody will eventually be in a position where they will try to convey some information to somebody else.

## Teaching is not reciting
This is maybe one of the more obvious things. But I myself see this way too often. Examples are presentations where the presenters are mostly just reading either their notes or the presentation itself or people just reading an excerpt from a book/journal/etc. to explain what is happening. It mostly happens because it is the easiest to do. This is the thing that was already prepared and has a simple structure.

But this has a problem: People could just read it themselves. They do **not** gain anything from just someone reciting something. I would also argue that this is even worse than telling people to read it themselves as this leads to:
1. The recipients not being able to revert to a position that they maybe didn't comprehent that well.
2. A very monotonous teacher that could even discourage people from wanting to understand that subject.
3. A limited understanding by the teacher about the subject (I will get into this later on).

This also is closely linked with the problem that the person that is reciting is just telling someone the information without actually making sure that the person that receives this information actually understands it. And knowing facts does not have any use if the person does not know what those actually mean.

## Interactivity is king
*So. How do we teach people properly?*

This is a hard question as this depends on the audience. But there are still some things that can be generalized. Learning requires that the recipients not only listen to the input, but rather think, plan and discover these things themselves. They should not only be treated as a receiver, but also as person that works with you to solve one problem: "Understanding this topic".

### The fun in learning
We do want to learn. We are natually curious on how the world and our surrounding works. But there is one main factor that has to be considered: [We want to have fun whilst learning](https://www.litmos.com/blog/articles/why-people-learn). That's why kids play a lot. They are learning.

So. If you want to teach, make it fun. Do stupid things, be over the top, make them laugh. And most importantly: Be yourself. Don't be overly stiff and make things boring. Make people want to do this.

Yes. There are obviously other ways to make them learn (like tests and rewarding them with money), but those are all extrinsic. Make this want intrinsic. The best teachers I ever had made me want to keep learning even though there are no rewards.

### Piquing their interest
But unfortunately often there are situations where people say: "They have to learn this, but if we wouldn't force it they wouldn't learn."

And I hate this sentiment.

I am a firm believer in the idea that every single topic, not matter how seemingly "boring", can be conveyed in a way that is interesting and fun. But because we try to find a solution for all people and just force them through an education system that is designed for as many as possible (and I think that this similar around the world and not just where I live), we lose the ability to make people truly invested.

Things like mathematics should not be treated as something that is a necessary evel, but rather as a new way to think on how to approach and solve a problem. When you tell people that mathematics are just some numbers that are being shuffled around, they do not think that this is important. But if the teacher supports them in solving a problem with mathematical elements they will be stoked to learn (And I do not mean those absolutely stilted problems where someone has for some reason 1000 apples).

## The knowledge of the teacher
The best way to learn a topic is to teach it. If you actually try to convey information you have to be able to rephrase it and dig into the topic yourself. And if you are able to do that, you have understood that part. This also means that by trying to explain stuff to others you are actively thinking about the topic and internalizing it.

But if the teacher just cobbles things together and recites it without changing anything, they do not have actually understood the topic and with that are not really that helpful for the learner. This is actually a detrument to the learner as they internally know that the person that is trying to convey the topic to them is not reliable. They cannot be asked complex questions and do not have the ability to change the way of explaining to accommodate the student.

The teacher has to have a larger amount of knowledge about the topic than they are trying to convey so that they understand the reasons why this is the case.

But there is also one thing that a teacher should also be: Honest when they do not know something. Knowing the limits of oneself is something that is also a good quality that people appreciate.

## Teaching is a lot of work
But to be a good teacher, there is a lot of stuff that needs to be done. At first the teacher has to know about the topic. And then they also have to plan and then execute different depending on the audience.

I, myself, have created hundreds of documents and presentations just to guide people. And then there is a lot of experimentation with other ways of teaching like creating games, building interactive environments, going to different places and organizing the entire thing.

But this work also pays off as it:
1. Helps yourself understanding different parts of the topic yourself
2. Leads to great results
3. Can make the audience happy

So: Don't be afraid of putting a little bit more work and don't be afraid to be creative.

## My own successes and failures
So. Let's stop rambling about different things and actually state my own successes and failures:

- I once tried to help a room full of people learn programming. The main problem was that there were many people with a strict curriculum and most people were there so they did not have to do something else. This meant that I was mostly hopping between different people and fixing many small things where they had issues.

  The amount of people and the little time meant that I tried to be as fast as possible with every person which meant that sometimes I just told them what they had to do. This obviously wasn't the best thing.

- A person I knew wanted to learn programming. So they tried to find some project they wanted to to. At the end they wanted to do something similar to modding a game. But they have never even programmed once. So they were quite enthusiastic and at the end always have always gotten to the point where they wanted to be, we unfortunately didn't manage to explain many different concepts which meant that most stuff they did was mostly held together by duct-tape. It was a mess.

  They were at a level where they could create full GUIs, but didn't know the difference between an attribute and a method. So I would consider this a failure.

- I once held a presentation about different datastructures and why they are important to consider when designing a program. The problem: My audience was at a technical level where they didn't even use a desktop computer and at a maximum worked with an iPad.

  So I had to become creative. I created a physical card game where two different groups had to race against each other in finding all different cards that had some specific properties. And every single card had around six different properties. So they had to think of a layout in which they could, regardless of my request, access those cards.

  And it worked beautifully.

- I am, for some reason, very good at rambling about different societal topics like history and politics. And it is always a mixture of enthusiasm and disgust. I am fast and I know that most information is mostly not received. But I know that people get interested in those topics themselves. When I tell them about the connections and reasons why people did what they did and how things are often not as simple as they seem, I mostly get some facepalms and chuckles about the stupidity and elaborate things that happened in history.

  And this is mainly something I believe is a way of transferring knowledge and rambling myself.

## Conclusion
Teaching is hard. And I am glad that there are so many people that are always trying to teach others on how to do things as it is also quite important. Our society relies on the fact that we are able to pass knowledge to other people.

But if you actually try to teach you did already half of the battle.

So. Please teach others and don't be afraid of making mistakes. Be creative and make people happy. And make people enthusiastic about the topic.
