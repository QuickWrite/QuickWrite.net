## Some projects I've built:
1. [Tau](https://github.com/QuickWrite/tau) - a programming language written in C which is mainly just a Turing Machine. <br>
   This was mainly built for educational (and recreational) purposes.
2. [fluent4j](https://github.com/QuickWrite/fluent4j) - a Java library that implements the [Mozilla Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) syntax for multilingual applications. <br>
   This project also makes the parser extensible so that custom syntax can be used. 
3. [KotlinJsonParser](https://github.com/QuickWrite/KotlinJsonParser) - a simple JSON parser written in Kotlin.
4. Some other things will be added soon...
